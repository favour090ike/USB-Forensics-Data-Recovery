# USB Forensics – Data Recovery Project

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic digital forensic investigation on a USB flash drive. The goal is to analyze a storage device, recover deleted files, and document forensic findings using Autopsy.

The project simulates a real-world forensic scenario where an investigator examines removable media for evidence.

# Step 1: Case Creation
- Created a new forensic case in Autopsy
- Assigned a case name and investigator details
- Selected appropriate time zone settings

# Step 2: Data Source Addition
- Added the USB flash drive as a data source
- Generated a host name automatically
- Configured ingest modules for analysis

# Step 3: Analysis
- Scanned the USB for files and folders
- Recovered deleted files
- Analyzed file metadata (timestamps, file type, size)
- Reviewed artifacts generated by Autopsy

# Step 4: Evidence Review
- Identified relevant files
- Verified recovered data
- Captured screenshots of findings

# Step 5: Reporting
- Documented findings clearly
- Generated a forensic report
- Stored evidence responsibly in Github
